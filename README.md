## The unofficial Insightful Operations Group Intellectual Property Vault

This Github account contains all the code developed for the purpose of demonstrating our capabilities as well as for reuse to expedite Project engagements.

At present, it contains the following:
1. A basic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Python asset that takes a series of GPS coordinates from an Excel file and orders it based on the shortest path from a starting/distribution point. Uses IBM Cplex.
2. The exact same result using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm in Python. Much faster, no overhead or licensing required, but results may not be as optimal especially with larger waypoints.
3. A more developed version using C# with the .NET platform using WinForms for the Windows Platform. Features point-and-click capability to select waypoints from a map in addition to ingesting from an Excel or CSV file.
4. A basic Nurse Scheduling Asset using Google OR that uses most of the sample code from the Google OR Tools samples.
5. The exact same Nurse Scheduling Asset with IBM Cplex.
